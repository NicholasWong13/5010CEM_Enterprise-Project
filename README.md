# 5010CEM Enterprise-Project 
# Studio C Hair & Beauty Salon 

Introduction: 
Our project is focused on developing a Hair Salon Website which can deal with customer’s enquiries and reviews, order processing, stock control and marketing.
The website will enable customers to view the background information of the salon as well as time-to-time promotion displayed at the homepage for the customers. 
Customers will be able to receive birthday promotions based on their past experiences in the salon. 
Besides that, customers are also able to make appointments online via the website. They can simply just insert the booking details such as name, phone number, services interested and timeline. 
After customers make their payment, submit the form and they will receive a booking confirmation. 
Apart from that, the website allows customers to send feedback to the salon. For instance, sending an overall rating of the salon’s services. 
Lastly, the information of the customers will be stored in the database and salon’s staff can view them through the admin panel created.
